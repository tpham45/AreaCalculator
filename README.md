# Room Area Calculator

The Room Area Calculator is a Python application that allows users to input the dimensions of various rooms in a house and calculates the total area of the house. It provides a convenient way to estimate the area of individual rooms and obtain the cumulative area of the entire house.

## Features

- User-friendly interface: The application prompts users to input the dimensions of each room and guides them through the process.
- Accurate calculations: The program ensures precise area calculations by multiplying the length and width of each room.
- Input validation: The application validates user inputs to prevent negative or invalid values, ensuring accurate results.
- Error handling: The program handles errors gracefully, displaying helpful error messages when incorrect inputs are provided.
- Formatted output: The calculated areas are displayed in a properly formatted output, providing a clear view of the results.
